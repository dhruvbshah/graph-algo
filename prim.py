'''

    Associate with each vertex v of the graph a number C[v] (the cheapest
    cost of a connection to v) and an edge E[v] (the edge providing that
    cheapest connection). To initialize these values, set all values of C[v]
    to +âˆž (or to any number larger than the maximum edge weight) and set
    each E[v] to a special flag value indicating that there is no edge
    connecting v to earlier vertices.
    
    Initialize an empty forest F and a set Q of vertices that have not yet
    been included in F (initially, all vertices).
    
    Repeat the following steps until Q is empty:
        Find and remove a vertex v from Q having the minimum possible value
        of C[v]
        Add v to F and, if E[v] is not the special flag value, also add E[v]
        to F
        Loop over the edges vw connecting v to other vertices w. For each
        such edge, if w still belongs to Q and vw has smaller weight than
        C[w], perform the following steps:
            Set C[w] to the cost of edge vw
            Set E[w] to point to edge vw.
            
    Return F
